                <p>Greetings! Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. 
                My name is Arpit, and I'm currently pursuing Computer Science at Dalhousie University, Halifax.
                I have great interest in all the major areas of Computer Science: Programming, Web-development, Database management, etc.
                Though if I had to choose one I would probably go for Programming since challenging problems always intrigue me.
                I am also especially passionate about game development.</p>

                <p class = "project-content">The good ol' flappy bird game, made entirely in Java. Avoid the obstacles as the bird flies.
                    The game uses game-loops which update the screen 60 times each second (a video is basically
                    a collection of many images). This game uses passive rendering to paint the objects.

                <p class = "project-content">In this game you have to shoot the boxes falling from the top using a turret at the bottom.
                    The game ends when any of the boxes touch the ground (or the turret). 
                    This game also uses game loops, but uses active rendering to paint the objects.
